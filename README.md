# Password Generator Challenge
 
 In this challenge, I created a random password generator.

 ## The task

 Make a password generator that met the set acceptance criteria and User Story that was provided

 ## User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```
## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```

## Challenges Faced

Some challenges that arose were:
- Getting the password to generate after getting the full criteria set
- Making the password work with all the different criterias and examples possible

## Solutions

Keep on trying new things and researching where I went wrong and what I should fix.
